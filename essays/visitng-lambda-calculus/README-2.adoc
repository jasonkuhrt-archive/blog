# A layman's foray into Lambda Calculus

## introduction
* i am trying to better grasp functional programming
* lambda calculus is the foundation of functional programming
* taking some time to understand this layer made sense to me
* i am also generally curious about elegant systems meaning those with properties like clear delineations, internal and external consistency, simplicity, minimal cognitive overhead, and so on
* i have a practical interest in improving my day to day work like what systems i choose to leverage or how i design my own systems
* i also however experience great joy when simulating beautiful systems in my mind not unlike what one may experience upon looking at a painting or listening to a musical composition.

## what is lambda calculus
* it was developed in the 1930s over several iterations chiefly by mathematician Alonzo Church
* a formal system in mathematical logic for expressing computation based on function abstraction and function application using variable binding and variable substitution
* a set of operations can be iteratively applied on an expression thereby successively reducing it.
* if the expression is non-terminating then this process will iterate forever
* otherwise the repeated reducing steps will eventually culminate to an expression that cannot be further reduced

## Why lambda calculus

## What does lambda calculus look like
* there are three lambda terms: variables, abstractions, expressions
* variables are names which refer an unknown expression
* abstractions are single-parameter functions
* expressions are combinations of and/or variables and abstractions
* abstractions have a head and body. The head has one parameter which is a variable. The body is an expression.
