## About

TIL standards for "Today I Learnt". The idea is by recording small things learnt their learning will be better retained. In the large I think it also provides a nice rough way of tracking progress every once in a while, and finding patterns in one's self that would otherwise be missed. This idea is not mine, but rather what I've seen others do e.g. https://github.com/jbranchaud/til/commits/master[here] https://github.com/thoughtbot/til[here] and https://github.com/milooy/TIL[here]. I think its a nifty idea worth emulating.

Items below are ordered latest to oldest. Look at the git history for the actual dates.

## TIL

* https://dgraph.io[dgraph] has enough power in its query language to apply both collaborative-based and content-based filtering strategies https://blog.dgraph.io/post/recommendation[link] https://blog.dgraph.io/post/recommendation2/[link].

* _collaborative-based filtering_ is a broad strategy for recommending things based upon matching like-users and then recommending to one based on another(s).

* _cold-start_ problem refers to being unable to integrate a new user into collaborative-based filtering for lack of data with that user.

* _content-based filtering_ is a broad strategy for recommending things based on their similarity to another given thing.
