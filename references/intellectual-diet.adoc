## About

This is my list of content references that I appreciated reading/viewing or want to eventually read/view. I make no claim of having a great diet, but I hope that by putting it to paper, I can be more honest with myself, transparent with others, and better retain links for future reference.

Takes me back to my days as a gamer intersected with my days as an artist. I'm neither these days but these was a lovely little crash course update into what's being going on culturally/socially, for me anyways.

This was interesting to me because it demonstrated values at the higher-education level that I've previously seen or experienced at the grade-school level with e.g. Waldorf School since having had children myself, and worked in technology for several years now. For example I recall reading how a cast of seemingly technology-guru types in California opted for a comparatively ludit-like approach to school for this kids. Personally my experience in technology has been that the role of pattern finder equiped with critical thinking is the basis of much innovation, beyond the stereotypical pragmatic analytical engineering-based persona. My role as an engineer but with a Fine Arts education tends to give me unexpected point of views that more often than not (or at least I would like to think) enable positive outcomes. That's not to say I envy anyone with similarly weak fundamentals as I in Math, Science, etc. but rather that I think there is a core of passion cutting across the substrate of all these disciplines, which paradoxically requires ones to turn away the daily world in order to be closer to it.
