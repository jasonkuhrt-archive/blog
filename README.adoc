# Hello!

This is my collection of thoughts, ideas, rants, stories, designs, opinions, or anything else I manage to conjure up. This content is hosted on the wonderful https://gitbook.com[Gitbook] platform and therefore https://github.com/jasonkuhrt/blog[the source is on Github]. If you are interested in what else I do beyond these writings check out my http://jasonkuhrt.com[my website]. Thanks for passing by! ðŸš€
