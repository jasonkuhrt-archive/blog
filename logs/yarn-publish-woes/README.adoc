# Yarn publish woes

2017 June 8

Given the following, the only reasonable solution is that for publishing modules, we still have to use `npm`.

* https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/722[does not act like `npm publish` in that it forces a TTY (TeleTYpewriter)]
* https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/2445#issuecomment-273284359[`npm publish` within `yarn run` fails with `ENEEDAUTH` error].
* https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1694[`yarn publish` sometimes hangs] (this happened at the ssense office today)
* https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/754[`yarn publish` does not honour .npmignore]. Consequently builds that are gitignored but should be part of the published package does not work.
* Example failure:
